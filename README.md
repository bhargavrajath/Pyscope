Serial communication DAQ using python

The INO file samples an analog pin on a supported MCU and transmits the voltage calculated over UART to serial port. This can be edited to add more channels.
By default, the INO is configured for Adafruit QTPY CM0+ board.

The python script demonstrates reading data from the serial port and plotting the values in real-time.
